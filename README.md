- 👋 Hi, I’m Ted Warren, or @tedJean (pronounced "Zjohn." Think of the action-movie star Jean-Claude Van Damme.
- 👀 I’m interested in furthering my programming skills and career.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to work with databases in SQL through Visual Studio and C#.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on work-related projects and analyzing scientific data.
- 📫 How to reach me by email: ted.warren@gmail.com

A number of projects on here are answers to problems that I have encountered in books on learning how to program. For potential employers, I am willing to share these during an
interview. But b/c the author's do not want the answers shared, I have these set on private so no one could use them to cheat. They are proof of my work though.
